  ItemDescription: Circular pieces of steel connected witha leather strip. Something
    illegible is written on one.
  ItemThoughts: This belonged to an invader in my home, while dead he will be mourned
    but not missed.
  ItemPositiveThoughts: Even if he wasn't here for our sake, this still belongs to
    someone's son. One last thing to commemorate him.
  ItemNegativeThoughts: What difference does it make where these end up? The owner
    didn't belong here anyways.
