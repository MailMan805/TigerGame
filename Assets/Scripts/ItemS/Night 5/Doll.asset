  ItemDescription: A doll made from rough cloth and straw resembling a little girl
    that is now stained in blood.
  ItemThoughts: 
  ItemPositiveThoughts: I had a doll like this when I was a girl; her name was Saanvi.
    She wore a pink sari made from scraps.
  ItemNegativeThoughts: The only reminder of her innocence; she was too young. She
    should have been protected from a death like this.
