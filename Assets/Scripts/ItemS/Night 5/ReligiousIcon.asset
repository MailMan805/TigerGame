  ItemDescription: An abstract representation of the divine creative energy of the
    universe.
  ItemThoughts: 
  ItemPositiveThoughts: Many people turn to Shiva for spiritual balance. Hopefully
    this one found peace within their prayers.
  ItemNegativeThoughts: The will of a God or not, these people shouldn't be dying
    like this. Much less my poor husband.
