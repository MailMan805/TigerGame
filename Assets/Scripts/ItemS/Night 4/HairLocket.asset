    string.
  ItemThoughts: 
  ItemPositiveThoughts: This looks as though taken care of. I hope she finds peace
    in death, I'm sure her family will want this to remember her by.
  ItemNegativeThoughts: How could you lose something that one should hold so close
    to their heart? You were a mother. You deserved better.
