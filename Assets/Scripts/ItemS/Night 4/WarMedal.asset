  ItemDescription: A shiny metal token with a ribbon engraved in the same illegible
    language as the journal.
  ItemThoughts: Medals are given out to commemorate hard word and courage. From what
    I've seen soldiers do I wonder where the courage part comes from.
  ItemPositiveThoughts: Something to commemorate hard wonk. This shows what kind
    of a worker the soldier laying in front of me was.
  ItemNegativeThoughts: I'm sure every soldier has this. Ironically, there's nothing
    special about this medal.
