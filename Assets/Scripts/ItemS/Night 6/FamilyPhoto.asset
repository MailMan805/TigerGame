  ItemDescription: A grainy photo of a happy family.
  ItemThoughts: I miss my family. I'll never see them again, now.
  ItemPositiveThoughts: These smiling faces remind me of my own family. I wonder,
    if I show my face, would they be happy to see me?
  ItemNegativeThoughts: This photo reminds me of my own family. This is what could've
    been if they didn't leave me to rot.
