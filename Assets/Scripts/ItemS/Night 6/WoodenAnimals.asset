  ItemDescription: Small wooden carvings of an elephant, a monkey, and a tiger.
  ItemThoughts: It's a bad omen to be carrying visages of a tiger and innocence into
    these parts.
  ItemPositiveThoughts: I wanted to make some of these one day, for a baby we will
    never have.
  ItemNegativeThoughts: A child should be playing with these at home, not dead on
    the forest floor. May the world that didn't protect you burn.
