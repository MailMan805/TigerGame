  ItemDescription: Made out of red sandalwood. Still being clutched in the hands
    of the victim in front of you, it seems her last act of self-defense was desperate
    prayers.
  ItemThoughts: 
  ItemPositiveThoughts: May her soul rest. These beads must've meant a lot to her
    if she trusted her life with them.
  ItemNegativeThoughts: What made you so sure these were going to save you?
