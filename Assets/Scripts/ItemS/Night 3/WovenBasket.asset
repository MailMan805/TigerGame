  ItemDescription: A beaten up basket used to collect foragables.
  ItemThoughts: RAAAHHHH
  ItemPositiveThoughts: Alma, jujube, fig... this has a good variety. Terrible that
    it has to go to waste... Then again, I could use what was foraged for something.
  ItemNegativeThoughts: Why not just buy from the market? There's lots of dangerous
    plants out here.
