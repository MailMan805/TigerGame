  ItemDescription: A teak, hexagon shaped jewelry box, ordained with floral pattern
    of green and red. There's nothing inside.
  ItemThoughts: this aint my dad, this is a cell phone
  ItemPositiveThoughts: This must've been used for some kind of proposal. Even if
    the jewelry is not inside, this still holds memories.
  ItemNegativeThoughts: Only using something so beautiful for just what you need,
    then leaving it behind once it's served it's purpose. Seems like it won't be
    missed.
