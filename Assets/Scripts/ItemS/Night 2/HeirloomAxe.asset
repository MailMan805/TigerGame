  ItemDescription: An iron axe with quite a bit of wear to it. It has the owner's
    name engraved on the hilt.
  ItemThoughts: It's still sharp despite its age. Someone used to take good care
    of it.
  ItemPositiveThoughts: For a tool that's been passed down several generations, this
    is in really good shape. It's owners have taken great care of it.
  ItemNegativeThoughts: Taking such a prized posession into a place like this? Should
    this really belong to someone so careless?
